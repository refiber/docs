# Getting Started

Refiber's journey began as a quest to explore the Go language and its potential for building a modern framework. Inspired by the Laravel and Inertia.js architecture, I embarked on this project, leveraging the robust foundation provided by the GoFiber framework.

## Installation Guide

To install Refiber, you first need to install the installer/CLI. Use the following command

```sh
go install github.com/refiber/refiber-cli@latest
```

Now you can just run `refiber-cli new my-app` to create new Refiber project.
